## How does it work?

Grab your instrument and play the notes between C3 and B3. The game will detect the pitch
and move the main character across the screen. The objective is to grab as many stars as
possible. The stars are places on the notes of the playing chord. Happy rehearse/play!

## How is this built?

Those are the libraries I've used:

  - [Teoria.js](https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria)
  - [Timbre.js](http://mohayonao.github.io/timbre.js)
  - [fft.js](https://github.com/JensNockert/fft.js)
  - [pitch.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/pitch.js-demo)
